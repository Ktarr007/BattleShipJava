#BattleShip Java Game

With your pair programming partner and table team, design a 2-D array of 5 rows and 5 columns.

Divide your table team so that each pair programming team designs (pseudo code), codes, and tests 1 of the following components of Battleship:

A.)  Using a random number generator, populate the 5 x 5 board with “battleships” (use 1’s & 0’s to simulate)

B.)  Request the user to enter a location where a battleship may be found (ask for row and column location). Keep track of all the user’s guesses (hint: store them in another 2D array)

C.)  Validate the user input, and check to see if a battleship has been “hit”.  Re-draw the board with the battleships, and show the user all of his / her guesses so far.

Create “method stubs” for the missing methods, and test your own method with hardcoded values returned from the method stubs.
As each pair programming team finishes testing their method, add the method to your program, and re-test.
Continue this process until entire table has tested entire program. Good luck!
